## Abstract

Machine learning [@www-machine-learning-wash] has affected many aspects of many
industries, with the expectation that this will continue to grow. Financial
advice [@www-fintech-ai] are one such industry that has been heavily impacted by
artificial intelligence and machine learning concepts. This project explores
ways that Tensorflow [@www-tensorflow] methods can be used in a Python 3.6
[@www-python-36] environment. We will cover many of the algorithms inherent to
Tensorflow libraries [@www-tensorflow] and use cases for them. The storage for
this project will occur externally, enabling this project to be performed using
cloud computing [@www-machine-learning-cloud]. Data sources are pulled from the
Google Finance [@www-google-finance]. The code is used from the aforementioned
sources and code as written by the author of this paper 
[@www-fa18-523-63-project-code]. The goal of any financial advisor is to make
decisions that beat the rate of inflation. There are large amounts of 
uncertainty with any decision made regarding the New York Stock Exchange
[@www-nyse]. An intelligently built and well-diversified investment portfolio
can prove to be very lucrative.


## Introduction

One possible way of structuring the document.
We may have to tweak this example as we progress.

Make sure paragraphs are 80 chars wide 

Place images in an images directory

Use empty lines before and after headings

In [@vonLaszwski-fa18-sample-report] we can find a sample report.

Naturally the headings are just suggestions and you may change them as
appropriate for your project.

## Requirements

All images must be referred to in the text. The words bellow and above
must not be used in your paper for images, tables, and code.

+@fig:fromonetotheorther shows a nice figure exported from Powerpoint
to png. If you like you can use this as a basis for your drawings.

![A simple flow chart](images/from-one-to-the-other.png){#fig:fromonetotheorther}

Figures must not be cited with an explicit number, but automated
numbering must be used. Here is how we did it for this paper:

```

for your drawings.
