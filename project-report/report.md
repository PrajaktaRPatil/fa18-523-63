## Abstract

Machine learning [@fa18-523-63-www-machine-learning-wash] has affected many
aspects of many industries, with the expectation that this will continue to
grow. Financial advice [@fa18-523-63-www-fintech-ai] are one such industry that
has been heavily impacted by artificial intelligence and machine learning
concepts. This project explores ways that Tensorflow [@fa18-523-63-www-
tensorflow] methods can be used in a Python 3.6 [@fa18-523-63-www-python-36]
environment. We will cover many of the algorithms inherent to Tensorflow
libraries [@fa18-523-63-www-tensorflow] and use cases for them. The storage for
this project will occur externally, enabling this project to be performed using
cloud computing [@fa18-523-63-www-machine-learning-cloud]. Data sources are
pulled from the Google Finance [@fa18-523-63-www-google-finance]. The code is
used from the aforementioned sources and code as written by the author of this
paper  [@www-fa18-523-63-project-code]. The goal of any financial advisor is to
make decisions that beat the rate of inflation. There are large amounts of
uncertainty with any decision made regarding the New York Stock Exchange
[@fa18-523-63-www-nyse]. An intelligently built and well-diversified investment
portfolio can prove to be very lucrative.
